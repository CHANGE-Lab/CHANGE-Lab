:wave: Hi! Welcome to the CHANGE Lab, run by Dr. Stephanie Green (PI)

✨ We are a lab group in the Biological Sciences dept. at the University of Alberta  - https://greenlab.ca     
:question: What do we work on?  

:exclamation: We focus on the causes and consequences of biodiversity change in marine ecosystems, with the goal of developing science-based tools to inform conservation and restoration under global change. 
Our lab uses a range of methods—including 
* :tropical_fish: behavioural observation
* 🌍 field experiments
* 🖥️ theoretical and statistical models
* 📈 stakeholder surveys
* 🗺️ studies along environmental disturbance gradients
To understand how drivers like biological invasion, climate change, and harvesting are altering the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems and the goods and services they provide to people

Please contact our our PI, Dr. Green, with any questions (stephanie.green@ualberta.ca)[stephanie.green@ualberta.ca]
